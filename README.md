This is a project for Thinkful. The components within this project include HTML, CSS and JavaScript that compile into a program that allows you to decode Caesar and
Polybius style encoding. The assignment was to create a gift for a friend, a digital Decoder Ring. This project was challenging at the time, because I hadn't 
done anything that large + made so many different files work together. It was a focus on editing multiple JS files and compiling them on one HTML page.
